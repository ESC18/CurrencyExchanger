## Description of Application:
This web application is a Currency converter, you can input any currency code (EX: USD) and state how much of said currency you want to convert (EX:200) and then convert it to another currency (EX: EUR) to get a result in how much of said currency you would have from converting your initial currency.

## Setup and installation requirements/guide:

2. Proceed to navigate to the highest level of your directory.
3. Open _"blank"_
4. Install all packages with _$ npm install_
5. Build the project using webpack with _$ npm run build_
6. Starting a development server with _$ npm run start_
7. Lint JS files in the src folder with _$ npm run lint_
8. Create a .env file with a variable of _API_KEY_
9. Create a .gitignore file and add the appropiate files/folders to it as well as the .env file
10. Sign up for an API Key at _https://www.exchangerate-api.com/_ and give the _API_KEY_ variable from within the .env file the value of the key.

## Known Bugs:
* Will not accept lowercase inputs for the currency types - you must write in all caps. (EX: "usd" doesn't work but "USD" does).
* Small things that would be nice to add; commas added to long numbers. A list of different currencies.
